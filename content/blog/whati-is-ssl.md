# What is SSL (Secure Socket Layer)?

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tyfnacici/tyfnacici/main/static/blog/what-is-ssl/ssl.jpg)

SSL (Secure Socket Layer) is a cryptographic protocol used to ensure security during data transmission over the internet. It is one of the most commonly used protocols to secure communication on the internet. SSL ensures that data is transmitted securely, preventing unauthorized persons from intercepting or altering the information. This article will detail how SSL works, its applications, and the process of ensuring security.

## How Does SSL Work?

SSL is provided by two main components: encryption and authentication. It is used as a security protocol between two parties that will communicate.

1. Encryption: SSL ensures that the data sent during communication is encrypted. This prevents the data from being read or understood clearly. Data encrypted with SSL can only be read by the recipient with the correct decryption key.

2. Authentication: SSL uses digital certificates to authenticate the identity of the server being communicated with. This allows the user to verify that the server they are communicating with is legitimate and comes from a trusted source. This process occurs when the server sends its digital certificate to the browser attempting to access it. The browser checks if the certificate is valid and, if it is, continues the communication.

## What is an SSL Certificate?

An SSL certificate is a digital document that verifies the identity of a website and ensures that data sent during visits to the website is encrypted. An SSL certificate proves the ownership and trustworthiness of the website. SSL certificates are signed and issued by an authorized Certificate Authority (CA).

## SSL Application Areas

The use of SSL is quite extensive and commonly used in various areas such as:

- Web Security: SSL is used to secure communication between websites. Web pages are encrypted using the HTTPS protocol to protect users' personal information, credit card details, and other sensitive data.

- Email Security: SSL is used to secure communication between email servers. This ensures a secure connection between the email sending and receiving servers, preventing email traffic from being intercepted or altered by unauthorized persons.

- Application Security: SSL can also be used to secure communication between applications. SSL is essential for financial applications, healthcare services, and other applications that transfer sensitive information.

## Types of SSL Certificates

There are several different types of SSL certificates. A certificate can be applied to a single website or multiple websites, depending on the type:

- Single Domain: A single domain SSL certificate applied to one domain name (e.g., www.cloudflare.com).
- Wildcard: Like a single domain certificate applied to one domain name but also covers subdomains of that domain. For example, a wildcard certificate can cover www.cloudflare.com, blog.cloudflare.com, and developers.cloudflare.com, while a single domain certificate can only cover the first.
- Multi Domain: As the name suggests, multi-domain SSL certificates can be applied to multiple unrelated domain names.

SSL certificates also come with different levels of validation. A validation level is like a background check, and the level changes depending on the thoroughness of the check:

- Domain Validation: This is the lowest level of validation and the cheapest. All a business needs to do is prove they control the domain.
- Organization Validation: This is a more involved process: The person or business requesting the certificate reaches out directly to the CA. These certificates are more trusted by users.
- Extended Validation: This requires a full background check of an organization before issuing an SSL certificate.

### SSL Security Process

The security process provided by SSL consists of the following steps:

1. Client Connects to Server: The client (usually a web browser) sends a request to connect to the server.

2. Server Authenticates: The server sends its digital certificate to the client. The client verifies the server's certificate and confirms the server's identity.

3. Key Exchange: A key exchange occurs between the client and server. This ensures that the transmitted data is securely encrypted.

4. Secure Communication: A secure communication channel is established between the client and the server. Data is transmitted in encrypted form and can only be read by the recipient with the correct decryption key.
